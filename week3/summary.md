Part 3 of the paper, titled "CLCB Algorithm and Theoretical Analysis," presents the Combinatorial Lower Confidence Bound (CLCB) algorithm designed for the offline learning framework of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (Off-CMAB). 

For a **CLCB Algorithm**, **Lower Confidence Bounds** are computed for each base arm using empirical data, with a pessimistic adjustment to address uncertainty. These LCBs are used as inputs to an approximation oracle, which selects a combinatorial action to maximize the worst-case reward function. The algorithm penalizes base arms with insufficient data, thus preventing decisions based on unreliable data.

Analysis in this part focuses on the **suboptimality gap**, which measures the reward difference between the optimal action and the selected action. Under two novel data coverage conditions (infinity-norm and 1-norm), the CLCB algorithm is shown to achieve a near-optimal suboptimality gap, with the gap scaling with $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of offline samples. And **Theorem 1** provides a formal bound on the suboptimality gap, showing that CLCB can achieve near-optimal performance with high probability. Then a lower bound is derived for the specific **k-path problem**, showing that the theoretical performance of CLCB aligns with the lower bound derived for the problem, up to logarithmic factors.
